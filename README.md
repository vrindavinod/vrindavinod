hi, i'm [Vrinda Vinod], a passionate self-taught full stack web developer and a freelance software engineer from India. my passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. i take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

i am also a devops enthusiast and IITM Data Science student. I learned a lot from the start-up community and i love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through working for multiple start-ups.
